### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a graduate of Data Analytics for Business from St. Clair College, I have a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and business intelligence. I am passionate about finding insights and solutions from data that can drive business growth and innovation. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge as a Business Data Analyst.

I have two years of experience as a Data Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, where I managed and optimized Apache Airflow pipelines for ETL using Python, SQL, and Scala for Nielsen client in the retail industry. I hosted applications on AWS suite, identified and resolved bottlenecks, and mentored junior team members. I also led a Data Analysis project for StaffedUp, a web-based ATS application, where I conducted competitor analysis, data collection, EDA, and developed ML models to create customer segmentation and analysis. I provided suggestions that improved the website ranking and KPIs by 20% and 25% respectively. I am proficient in Agile Software Development, Data Science, and Apache Airflow, and I am eager to learn new technologies and tools.
